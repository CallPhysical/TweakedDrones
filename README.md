# TweakedDrones
Drone synth with 4 oscillators for Arduino Nano
Based on https://github.com/SoundCodes/8knobs
Added 3 additional oscillators to take advantage of the two toggle switches in BlogHoskins $20 Synth project aka Helios One
Changed reading of pots from 'all every update cycle' to 'only one per update cycle' to reduce clicks caused by read delays.
