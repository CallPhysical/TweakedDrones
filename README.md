# TweakedDrones
Drones_4_wave_X is a Drone synth with 8 oscillators for Arduino Nano
Based on https://github.com/SoundCodes/8knobs

Helios_Drone5_0 merges BlogHoskins Helios sketch with the Drones sketch. It needs two extra pots on A6 and A7, and an additonal switch on D4 to switch between Drone
and Helios modes. 

Helios_Drone5_0a is a 6-voice version of the same which will run on the standard Helios with any additional pots or switches. The position of the LFO switch sets the unit into either Drone or Helios mode at startup.
